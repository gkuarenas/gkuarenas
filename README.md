# Hi, I'm Guillaume 👋

BSMS Manufacturing Engineering & Management (DLSU) | Computer Vision • ML • Sensors • Automation  
Currently interested in projects that blend **engineering + AI**!

---

## 🔭 What I'm working on
- **Visuotactile / mechanoluminescent sensing** for non-invasive force estimation & localization (thesis work)
- **Computer vision defect detection** (YOLO + deployment optimizations)
- **Applied ML projects** (Kaggle-style modeling + clean EDA)
- Small **IoT / automation** builds (Node.js / dashboards / sensors)
